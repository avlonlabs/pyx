# PyX Manifesto — Building the AI-Native Web

The web was built for pages.  
Then it evolved for apps.  
Now, it must evolve for intelligence.

---

### 1. Simplicity First
AI development shouldn’t mean complexity.  
A developer should be able to build a full AI app with one command, one mindset.

### 2. Performance by Design
Rust runs our core not because it’s trendy — but because it’s honest about speed.

### 3. Python Is the Language of Thought
AI logic belongs in Python.  
PyX honors that — your reasoning layer should feel natural, readable, alive.

### 4. No More Divide
Frontend, backend, and intelligence belong in one ecosystem.  
No glue code. No “API middle layers.” One flow — idea → intelligence → interface.

### 5. AI as a Native Citizen
LLMs, memory, and embeddings aren’t plugins — they are **first-class** components of PyX.

### 6. Open by Default
PyX will always be open-source.  
Our license (Apache 2.0) means anyone can build, adapt, or improve PyX freely.

### 7. The Future Is Developer Intelligence
We’re not building a framework.  
We’re building a language between humans and machines.
